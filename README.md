# Minion-Bot-For-Streamers
Tool to get stats from the current war of the Clash of Clans API

1.  Download ZIP file from GitHuib
2.  Extract the ZIP folder
3.  In the extracted folder, open the following file.  Mac users may need to use the Terminal to open the file.  If opening this file does nothing, ensure you have .Net installed.\
    [Windows] MinionBotForTwitch.bat\
    [Mac]     MinionBotForTwitchMAC.sh\
4.  You will be prompted to enter your clan tag in the clantag.txt document.  Enter it and save the text file.
5.  Navigate to developer.clashofclans.com, create an account, and create a key.  Use your router's external IP address when making the key.
6.  Save the key to clash api token.txt.
7.  Restart the program.

It will now save statistics to documents\output in varios text files.
In OBS, set your scores and stats to read from files.

If you are apprehensive about running this, the source code is included.
This is adapted from old versions of Minion Bot for Discord.
This is not exactly well written, so I don't recommend you base your code off of this.

I would appreciate shout outs in your stream.

Enjoy!
